# 400.03 - GENERATE STRING
###################################

"""
write a generator 
- accepts a string and an integer called [frequency]
-- generate sequence as follows
--- [string[0] * frequency + string[1] * frequency + ... + string[-2] * frequency + string[-1] * frequency]

- your generaor should NOT store this string, it should generate the next element in the sequence each time its [next] method is called 

- you should createthis generator in both a functional and class based was

- functional should be named [generate_string]
- class should be named [GenerateString]

you may assume that frequency will allywas be >= 0


STARTING CODE >>> 

def generate_string(string, frequency):
    # Write your code here.
    pass


class GenerateString:
    def __init__(self, string, frequency):
        # Write your code here.
        pass

    # Write your code here.
