COMPILERS AND INTERPRETERS

/// you know this is going to be tough when the opening text is 
/// " this is where it gets complicated " 

Compiler =
- take source code
- convert machine code
-- bytecode = machine interpret
-- binary code = machine can execute

Interpreter = 
- capable of translatinng code (typical bytecode) into machine code
- that can be ran and executed by the CPU
- Python is first compiled to bytecode, bytecoode passed to interpreter to execute

Source Code =
- human-readable code

Bytecode = 
- program code
- been compiled
- lower-level language that can be understood by an interpreter

@actually - this blurb is simple enough, but what does Tim have in store for us?
