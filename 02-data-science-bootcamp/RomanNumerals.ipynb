There is another occurrence of V in the table: LVIII which equals 58. I can see the III again, so perhaps the III part contributes 3 to the value which would mean that LV = 55. It looks then as if roman numbers are sums of terms. III = I + I + I = 3. LVIII then might equal L + V + III. We know V is 5 and L is 50 (see table above), so this looks right too.\n",

In IV we have a small number followed by a larger one, whereas in VIII we have a larger number V followed by a smaller number III. Perhaps roman numbers are summed when the sequence is large-small but subtracted when small-large? Lets look at row 3 of Table 2.1 which says CIX=109. We can get 9 by subtracting 1 from 10 and we know from above that IX=9. So, we have another example of a smaller number coming before a larger one to give a subtraction (as in IV) Apply this to row 5.\n",

We also know C=100 and X=10 which would make XC=90 -- it's a small number followed by a larger one, so we subtract the first from the second, which means take 10 (X) from 100 (C). So, XCIX = 90+9 (rather, 100-10 + 10-1 !). Why is 99 not simply IC, i.e, 100-1? Apparently it's invalid, so perhaps there is a rule about how big the difference can be."

We know what the various sequences are for certain numbers: I=1, IV=4, V=5, IX=9, X=10, XL=40, L=50, XC=90, C=100, D=500, M=1000. The outline process, therefore, must involve dividing the decimal number repeatedly into small units until we get down to the 1s. For example, 20 = XX. Why? X is the largest roman numeral we can fit into 20. But 1 X only gives us 10 with a left over of 10. The left over can also be represented by an X. The number 70 = LXX. 70 can be divided by 50 once, so that gives us one L. The left over is 20 which divides by 10 twice to give XX. Put it together and we get LXX. 39 = 3 × X + 1 × IX: 3 10s plus a leftover of 9. We have a symbol for 9 = IX, so 39 = XXXIX."
