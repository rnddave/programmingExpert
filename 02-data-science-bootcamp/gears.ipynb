        "You work for an engineering company that has been tasked with helping out a world-class cyclist with the selection of gear wheels on her new bicycle. She needs to know, for each of 10 gears on the bike, how many times she must make one full turn of the pedals in order to travel 1 km. A bicycleâ€™s gear ratio is given as the ratio of the number of teeth on the chain wheel (the one the pedals are connected to) and the number of teeth on the gear wheel (the one attached to the rear wheel). The rear wheel has ten gear wheels all with a different number of teeth. The chain wheel has 36 teeth and the gear wheels have teeth as given in the following table.\n",
