        "The check digit in an ISBN is calculated by a Modulus 11 technique using the weights 10 to 2. This means that each of the first nine digits is multiplied by a number in a sequence from 10 to 2. If you then add these products together and then add the value of the check digit, this total sum should be divisible by 11 without leaving a remainder. If it does give a remainder then the check digit does not match the rest of the number and we know the ISBN has been copied down incorrectly. The check digit is calculated in the following manner:\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiply the first nine digits by 10, 9, 8, 7, ..., 2 respectively and add up the results. Divide this sum by 11 and take the remainder. Finally, subtract this remainder from 11 to give the check digit. If the value is 10 the check digit becomes ‘X’. For example, we can validate the ISBN 0-14-012499-3 as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\frac{(0\\times 10)+(1\\times 9)+(4\\times 8)+(0\\times 7)+(1\\times 6)+(2\\times 5)+(4\\times 4)+(9\\times 3)+(9\\times 2)}{11}$$\n",
