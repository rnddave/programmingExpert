Following the colon and on subsequent indented lines are all the statements that are required for the function to do what we want it to do. Finally comes an (optional) `return` statement which returns the value the function has computed. We say it is optional because it is possible to write functions that return no values but simply carry out a series of instructions. In this case the function is, in effect, a *procedure* (see chapter 10 of HTTLAP). The `print()` function is an example of this type of function. It simply displays its arguments on the screen and returns no values.\n",
