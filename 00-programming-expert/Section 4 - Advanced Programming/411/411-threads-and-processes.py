THREADS and PROCESSES

intersection of software and hardware

>>>>    THREAD          <<<<

- flow of execution of your program
- default = run in a single thread (main)
- if you need to speed it up, try concurrency
- important [thread] and [lock]

>>>>    PROCESS         <<<<

- application or prograrm running on computer
- allocated own memory space
- always contain at least one thread
- may be split into multiple threads that execute concurrently

>>>>    CONCURRENCY     <<<<

- ability to execute simultaniously

>>>>    PARALLELISM     <<<<

- several computations occuring at same time
- utilise multiple logical processing cores of a CPU to increase speed
- different to concurreny which uses a single logical CPU core
