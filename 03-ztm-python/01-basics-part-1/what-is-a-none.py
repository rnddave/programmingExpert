### we have seen NONE a few times: 

basket20 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
basket21 = basket20.append(5)
print(basket21) # None

# some times we want a variable to exist, but we don't want it to have a starting value

# for example, a player might start with no special abilities or weapons for example 

weapons = None # now we're basically keeping some space in memory for the object without actually filling it yet

print(type(weapons)) # <class 'NoneType'>
