## Sort Employees

# write a function that accepts a list of lists that contain the name, age, salary of specific employees
# and also accepts a string representing the key to sort employees by
# your function should return a new list that contatins the lists representing each employee
# sorted in ascending order by the given key

# (1) define function to sort employees
# (2) take input from user (sorting key)
# (1.b) Make a new list, sort the employees by the key provided and display

employees = [
    ["John", 33, 65000],
    ["Sarah", 24, 75000],
    ["Josie", 29, 100000],
    ["Jason", 26, 55000],
    ["Connor", 25, 110000],
]

def sort_employees(employees, sort_by):
    sort_indices = ["name", "age", "salary"]
    sort_index = sort_indices.index(sort_by)

    sorted_employees = sorted(employees, key=lambda x: x[sort_index])

    return sorted_employees

sort_by = input("Sort by what (age, name, salary)? ")

r = sort_employees(employees, sort_by)
print(r)
